        <p class="solid">Tachisme is a style of art popularized in Europe, particularly in France, around the 1940s and 1950s. Visual depictions of tachisme consist of stains, blobs, and markings. The name itself derives from the French word tache, which means stain. The work itself is spontaneous and abstract.</p>

        <p class="solid">Historically, tachisme surfaced with the trending art informel movement occurring post-World War II in France. Pierre Gueround, a French art critic, first uttered the term "tachisme" in a less than pleasant manner in 1951. Michel Tapié, a French art critic, later used the word in his book "Un art autre" to describe what is now considered tachisme in 1952. </p>
        <p class="solid">Tachisme emerged as a response to geometric abstraction and cubism. The art was spontaneous and intuitive in its abstractness. Furthermore, it differed from the traditional paintings of European abstract art in the 1940s and 1950s.  Wols, a German artist and photographer, is thought to be the founder of tachisme. His work depicting tachisme first debuted in René Drouin's Paris gallery in 1947. Wols' art demonstrated much of the techniques and stylings of the movement.</p>
        <p class="solid">The influences behind tachisme stem from its origins in gestural painting and the Art Informel artistic movement. Gestural painting is a style of fine art painting often defined by striking brushstrokes created through the artist’s hand movements while painting. There is an emphasis on the artistic process and the artist’s physicality in painting. Tachisme is a version of the gestural painting that is more abstract. The tachisme movement is synonymous with the Art Informel, a similar abstract art movement. The difference between the two movements is tachisme's emphasis on the artist’s hand gestures while painting.</p>

        <p class="solid">Tachisme reached its peak around the 1950s. Yet, the lingering effects of tachisme or relations to the movement are present in other artistic groups, such as Gutai and the COBRA group. Gutai is a Japanese art movement, while the COBRA is a European art movement.</p>
