                <h2>How did I get here?</h2>
                <p>Initially, I wanted to attend the University of Houston to major in industrial design. I was eager to learn about product design and everything related to making functional products for viable consumption. Therefore, I aspired to become an industrial designer to explore those interests. I got into the University of Houston. However, I did not make it into its industrial design program. The attendance costs were too expensive to hope I got into the program the following year while I attended the school. I applied to the University of Central Florida (UCF) as a pivot to my dreams of studying industrial design at an out-of-state university. </p>

                <p>I ultimately chose to attend UCF because of the different domains offered by the university's psychology program. I decided to major in psychology with a concentration on human factors. The human factors route provided an opportunity to learn about product usability and user experience from a psychological perspective. Eventually, I realized I wanted to pursue a career in user experience (UX) design instead of industrial design. There were some classes related to user experience that I could take if I decided to minor in digital media.  With that, the decision to minor in digital media soon followed. That is how I got here as a UCF student majoring in psychology with a minor in digital media. </p>

                <h2>The Lessons I Learned</h2>
            </a> 
            <ol>
                <li>Don't be afraid to ask questions or for help. The worst response you could get is probably no. You never know what kind of insight or help you might get without asking.</li>
                <li>Remain in the present. Living in the moment is challenging. However, you owe it to yourself to appreciate the moment and live for the now. </li>
                <li>There's only so much you can control, so try not to worry about the things you cannot control. It saves you from a lot of stress and anxiety. </li>
                <li> It never hurts to express gratitude. I am grateful for everything that has got me here, and this acknowledgment helps me appreciate life much more. </li>
            </ol>

                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            </a>
            <p>My time at UCF has been relatively short. I am graduating this spring semester. I only spent three years here, so graduating from UCF feels odd. I am entirely grateful for the experiences that led me to graduate a bit quicker. However, it is somewhat bittersweet. I did not savor the college experience as much as I wanted to. The ongoing COVID pandemic and my persistent anxiety dampened my excitement and engagement surrounding college. I strictly focused on my academics, which has significantly benefited me. Though, I did not push myself enough to connect with other people. I am a bit regretful about that. My journey at UCF often feels like an exhausting blur of time. I did not make any fruitful connections with anyone. Instead, I became more introspective. I learned more about myself as a student at UCF, so I appreciate the three years of introspection and personal development. I am eager for the next chapter of my life, and it could not be possible without my journey at UCF.</p>
